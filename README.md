# 🛠️ TriCraft

**_A Minecraft-inspired sandbox with a twist..._**  
Welcome to **TriCraft**, a voxel-based building game where the world isn't just made of cubes — **triangles** are part of the mix! This project is in its early stages and is a heavy work-in-progress, but we're excited to share what we've built so far and where we're headed.

## 🚧 Current Features

- ✅ **Block Rendering**  
  Render both cubic and triangular blocks in a dynamic 3D world.

- ✅ **Player Movement**  
  Basic first-person movement system.

- ✅ **Procedural Terrain Generation**  
  Terrain is generated using Perlin noise, with support for different elevation and formations.

## 🌟 Planned Features

- 🔺 **Triangular Block Mechanics**  
  Full interaction support for triangular blocks — place, break, rotate, and build with them seamlessly.

- 🌍 **Advanced World Generation**  
  Biomes, caves, floating islands, and layered terrain using enhanced procedural techniques.

- 🔨 **Crafting & Inventory System**  
  Craft items using collected resources and manage them in an intuitive inventory UI.

- ⚙️ **Physics Improvements**  
  Gravity-aware blocks, smoother collisions, and realistic movement over angled surfaces.

- ⛅ **Day/Night Cycle + Weather**  
  Dynamic lighting, sun/moon transitions, rain, snow, and ambient effects.

- 🏗️ **Creative Tools**  
  Tools designed for efficient building with triangular and standard blocks — snapping, rotation, and mirroring.

- 🌐 **Multiplayer Support**  
  Online world sharing and collaborative building with friends.

- 🎨 **Modding & Texture Packs**  
  Extend the game with user-made mods and custom textures.

- 🧱 **Game Modes**  
  Switch between creative mode for unrestricted building and survival mode for resource gathering and exploration.
